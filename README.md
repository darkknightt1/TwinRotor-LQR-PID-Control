# üöÅ Twin Rotor Pitch Control System

This project implements **pitch angle control** for a **twin rotor system** using both **PID** and **State-Space** methods. The system was modeled and tested using MATLAB/Simulink, with real-time control deployed on an **ESP32 microcontroller** via the Arduino IDE.
